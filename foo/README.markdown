### Sample Kata

This Kata doesn't have much to really do, it's just to establish the structure of the katas and make sure that you've got everything set up and know how to run them, before you really start working on one with some meat.

### Code Kata

This kata contains two files: `foo.rb` and `foo_spec.rb`.  `foo.rb` defines a class called `Foo`, with two methods: `initialize` and `greet`.  `initialize` will receive a name as a string.  `greet` should return a greeting to the given name.  Your task is to implement those two methods so that when:

    ruby foo_test.rb

is run, all of the tests it contains pass.
