### Texas Hold 'Em

In Texas Hold 'Em, the player is required to construct the best 5 card Poker hand from a set of 7 cardsâ€”two dealt secretly to them, and 5 communal cards.

Poker hands are ranked as follows:

1. **Royal Flush** *... this consists of the cards Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 of the same suit.*
2. **Straight Flush** *... this consists of five cards from the same suit in sequential order.*
3. **Four of a Kind** *... this consists of the same card in all four suits.*
4. **Full House** *... this consists of a set of one card in three suits, and a second card in two suits.*
5. **Flush** *... this consists of five cards of the same suit.*
6. **Straight** *... this consists of five cards in sequential order.*
7. **Three of a Kind** *... this consists of the same card in three suits.*
8. **Two Pair** *... this consists of two distinct pairs of cards.*
9. **One Pair** *... this consists of the same card in two suits.*
10. **High Card** *... this is just any single card.*

When comparing two hands in the same category, cards are compared highest to lowest among cards used in the set, and then among cards not used in the set.  (For the *Full House*, the set of 3 cards is compared, followed by the set of two cards).

### Code Kata

This kata contains two files: `texas_hold_em.rb` and `texas_hold_em_test.rb`.  `texas_hold_em.rb` defines a class `TexasHoldEm` with two methods: `initialize` and `best_hand`.  Your task is to impement these two methods, so that when you run:

    ruby texas_hold_em_test.rb

all of the tests it contains pass.

The tests will pass in to the initializer a string listing 7 cards separated by spaces.  A card will be two or three characters in the format `[Rank][Suit]`, where `[Rank]` is one of: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A` and `[Suit]` is one of `H, D, C, S`.

The tests expect `best_hand` to return a string of the form:

    [Rank] ([High Card] high)

where `[Rank]` is one of the 10 strings in bold above, and `[High Card]` is the rank of the first card used in tie-breaking.
