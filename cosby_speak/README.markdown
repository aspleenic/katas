### Cosby Speak

Bill Cosby speaks in a magical language of his own devising.  The purpose of this Kata is to convert English text into Cosby-speak, as well as converting Cosby's holy ramblings into something us mere mortals can parse.

English gets turned into Cosby speak by using the included image "Cosby Speak.jpg"

### Code Kata

This kata contains two files: `cosby_speak.rb` and `cosby_speak_test.rb`.  `cosby_speak.rb` defines a class `CosbySpeak`, with three methods: `initialize`, `to_english`, and `to_cosby`.  Your task is to implement these three methods, so that when you run:

    ruby cosby_speak_test.rb
    
all of the tests it contains pass.

Note that the tests assume Ruby 1.9
