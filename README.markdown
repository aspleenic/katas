### Code Katas

This is a series of test files for writing Code Katas at AS+.  Please clone this repository, and use the provided tests to develop your problem solutions.

### Katas

* Foo (This is a sample kata, just to get you started writing and running them)
* [Look and Say Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence)
* Bowling Scoring
* Texas Hold 'Em
* Ukulele Chords
* [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
* Bill Cosby's Own Strange Language

*Other Katas will be forthcoming.  Maybe write one yourself!*

#### Using this Repository

Please do not commit your solutions to the master branch.  If you want to add a new Kata, or add more tests for our existing Katas, then that's fine.

The tests are written using TestUnit only, and all the katas are written for Ruby 1.9
